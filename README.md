# <img src='edgylogo.png' width=62px heigh=62px> Edgy Sidebar (Windows)
Edge sidebar alternative, that works on Windows.<br>
On Linux it works, but Wayland doesn't allow click trough transparent yet, until i make workaround <br>
Old thing I made for random person on Discord (not vibe coded), cause he complained he misses Edge sidebar. <br>
I made it, but didn't post it until now (11.14.2025) <br>
This will be used for my desktop shell for Linux.<br>
<br>
**Demo in Windows (Virtual Machine) (taskbar doesn't come with it, it's old testing version of my shell):**<br>
