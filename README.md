# <img src='edgylogo.png' width=62px heigh=62px> Edgy Sidebar (Windows & Linux)
Edge sidebar alternative, that works on Windows.<br>
On Linux it works, but Wayland doesn't allow click trough transparent yet, until i make workaround <br>
Old thing I made for random person on Discord (not vibe coded), cause he complained he misses Edge sidebar. <br>
I made it, but didn't post it until now (11.14.2025) <br>
This will be used for my desktop shell for Linux.
